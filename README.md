## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned to deploy a static Next.js website on GitHub pages.  The folder structure in the GitHub repository matters and I needed to create the repository from the VS Code terminal and push up the code.  I also had to add the output: 'export' line in the next.config.mjs file and then run npm run build in the terminal in order to create the out folder which creates the HTML, CSS, JS assets for my website.  After the code has been committed, I would go to the pages section and use GitHub actions to automatically build and deploy the website.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
/**
 * @type {import('next').NextConfig}
 */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
}
 
module.exports = nextConfig
```



### Continued development

Next.js is becoming a popular framework and I would like to continue to practice creating more websites using Next.js.  I might try using one of Vercel's templates to start a project to get a better understaning of how this framework works.


### Useful resources

I also learned that the folder structure is important to deploy the website and I needed to create a repository from the vs code terminal.
